# testingPythonNews

**testingPythonNews** is a repository dedicated to testing and exploring the latest features of Python, as well as sharing resources, articles, and topics of interest related to the language and its ecosystem.

This project aims to be a space for experimentation and learning, where the newest Python features are implemented and documented, along with an index of content that links to all referenced sources and resources.

## Project Structure

- **Python Features**: Practical examples showcasing the latest features introduced in Python with each new version.
- **Interesting Resources**: Links and references to articles, documentation, and exciting Python-related projects.
- **Testing and Experimentation**: Proof of concept implementations to better understand Pythonâ€™s functionalities.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The project will primarily use Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for documentation and experimentation, making it easier to combine code, explanations, and results in one place.

### Notebook Template

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook template that will be used as a starting point for each new experiment. This template provides a consistent format to ensure readability and organization across all notebooks.

## Index of Contents

The index below provides links to the resources and sources used in the project.

1. [Python 3.13 Features]()
2. [Polars faster with cuda](https://pub.towardsai.net/polars-just-got-even-faster-7a91d7b5a26c)


> **Note**: This index will be updated regularly as new experiments and resources are added.
